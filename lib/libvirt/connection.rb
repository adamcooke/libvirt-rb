module Libvirt
  # Describes a connection to an instance of libvirt. This instance may be local
  # or remote.
  #
  # # Initiating a Connection
  #
  # ## Basic
  #
  # A basic example of initiating a connection is to just allow the libvirt client
  # library to choose the best (first available) hypervisor for you. If you're only
  # running one hypervisor or you're not sure what is available on your machine,
  # then this is the easiest option to get started:
  #
  #     conn = Libvirt::Connection.new
  #
  # A shortcut is also provided for your convenience:
  #
  #     conn = Libvirt.connect
  #
  # ## Specifying a URI
  #
  # Libvirt connections are made by giving a URI to libvirt, which can describe
  # a local or remote libvirt instance (remote being that `libvirtd` is running).
  # The following is an example of a local VirtualBox connection:
  #
  #     conn = Libvirt::Connection.new("vbox:///session")
  #
  # And perhaps a remote qemu connection:
  #
  #     conn = Libvirt::Connection.new("qemu+tcp://10.0.0.1/system")
  #
  # # Readonly Connections
  #
  # A readonly connection can be made by specifying the `readonly` option to be
  # truthy. A couple examples follow:
  #
  #     conn = Libvirt::Connection.new("vbox:///session", :readonly => true)
  #     conn = Libvirt::Connection.new(:readonly => true)
  #
  # # Basic Information of a Connection
  #
  # Once you have a connection object, you can gather basic information about it
  # by using methods such as {#hypervisor}, {#capabilities}, etc.:
  #
  #     puts "Hypervisor type: #{conn.hypervisor}"
  #     puts "Hypervisor version: #{conn.hypervisor_verison}"
  #     puts "Library version: #{conn.lib_version}"
  #
  class Connection
    # Opens a new connection to libvirt. This connection may be local or remote.
    # If a `uri` is given, an attempt to connect to the given URI is made. The URI
    # can be used to specify the location of libvirt along with the hypervisor
    # to connect to.
